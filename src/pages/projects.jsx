							Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide variety of
							projects—each one helping me grow as a developer and
							problem solver. While I’ve explored different areas
							through my work, the projects featured here are some
							of the most recent and meaningful to me. They
							represent a mix of internal tools built for
							organizational use as well as client-facing projects
							developed for small businesses and community
							partners. While web development has been my main
							focus, I’m excited to continue branching out into
							other areas and expanding my skills. Each project
							represents a step forward in my journey to learn,
							create, and make a real impact.
